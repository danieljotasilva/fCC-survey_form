*Leia essa pÃ¡gina em [PortuguÃªs](https://github.com/danieljotasilva/fCC-survey_form/blob/main/README.md).*

Form page created based on the design of [freeCodeCamp](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP).

## Objective
The objective of the project is to create a survey form page using only HTML and CSS.

## What I learned
In this project I was able to absorb many concepts related to forms. 
I was able to get to know and explore the different forms of input and their properties, using inputs from:
- Text;
- E-mail;
- Number;
- Dropdown;
- Radio; and
- Checkbox.

Last but not least, I worked on the CSS to make the page look more user-friendly and accessible, as well as working on minor changes to the responsiveness.

## Final Thoughts
As simple as the project may seem, through it I was able to consolidate some HTML and CSS concepts and explore a whole range of available inputs. I leave this project much more confident with regard to the two languages â€‹â€‹and with the certainty that many new concepts have been absorbed.
Thanks to freeCodeCamp for providing such rich content!

*To infinity and beyond!* ðŸš€
